This project is aimed at predicting crop diseases using deep learning. It utilizes a Keras-based model built in Python, designed to analyze images of plant leaves and classify them according to various diseases. The goal is to assist farmers by providing timely disease diagnosis, allowing them to take appropriate action.

The project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning architecture well-suited for image classification tasks. The dataset consists of labeled images of different crops and their associated diseases. The model is trained to recognize patterns in these images and predict the presence of diseases based on those patterns.

In terms of implementation, Python is used for the machine learning model, while Jupyter Notebooks (IPYNB) is employed for interactive development. The web interface, built using HTML, allows users to upload images and receive disease predictions in real time.

The model's accuracy is evaluated on a separate test set, and the results are presented on a web page. This system can provide farmers with a quick, reliable way to detect crop diseases and mitigate the risks associated with crop failure.
